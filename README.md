Image carousel that advances the slide every 5 seconds. It also has previous and next buttons, and navigation dots that jumps to the selected image.

Things learnt:
* Adding event listeners to the dots using a for loop (you can't use html onclick with JS modules)
* Setting intervals using setInterval()
